# ANALYSIS-OF-FOOTBALL-WORLDCUP

# ABSTRACT 

The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international
association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of
the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA),
the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every
four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946
when it was not held because of the Second World War.
In this project we will be using the online available data set consisting of the
data regarding different fixtures and results of matches from the year 1930 to
2014 I.e. the previous tournament. We will be analyzing and visualizing the
given data to given an organized analysis of the matches played and their
respective results. This also includes the statistics of the players and the number
of goals and penalties scored. We will also be analysing the improvements in
players’ forms and the respective player of the tournaments. Using this data, we
will predict the player of the tournament for the Fifa World Cup 2018.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Analysing the different aspects of the FIFA World Cup Tournament and
predicting “Man of the Tournament”. The main reason to choose this project is
that we know how unexpectedly match results changes and no one will be able
to guess the outcomes of the match. But by using the existing dataset
information, if we are able to plot the graphs that are needed we can observe the
trend in those graphs and predict the outcome of either a match or it can be a
player. This visualization helps us in predicting the outputs with more
understanding of the existing data and helps us to analyse the trends in the data.
Thus, the outcomes of project are more fruitful to predict.

# DATASET

My data set consists of data from the year 1930 to 2014.We extracted the
dataset from the official FIFA website which provides complete information
about the players, goals, teams from the past 80 years.

# FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The analysis is divided into three parts:
1. Analysis-1
2. Analysis-2
3. Analysis-3

ANALYSIS-I
1. Attendance of world cups by year
2. Average Attendance
3. Total Goals scored by year
4. Matches with highest number of attendance/average attendance
5. Cities with most world cup matches
6. Team with most world cup final victories
7. Team with most world cup matches

ANALYSIS-II
1. Home and away
a. Distribution of home and away goals.
b. Home and away goals by year.
c. Match outcomes by home and away teams.
2. Maximum Wins, Loses and draw ratio
3. Highest goals scored during matches.

ANALYSIS-III
1. Team interaction comparator(comparison between two teams)
2. Interaction between teams
3. Stadium by countries
4. Penalties
5. Penalty matches by year
6. Penalty matches by round
7. Penalty shoot out results by country
8. Match outcomes for countries playing quarter finals

# ALGORITHM DESIGN
My design follows a cyclic pattern of these steps:
1. Pre-processing data for outliners and missing data
2. Planning the model (Convolution neural network)
3. Importing files
4. Comparative analysis and Visualization
5. Start modelling
6. Prediction of “Man of the Tournament”

# IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

I will be using Python3 and its several Support Packages to develop the
analysis and visualization software. Some main Python3 packages to be used
are:
• Pandas
• Matplotlib
• Seaborn
• Numpy

For Predicting our model we will be using Tensorflow Framework
